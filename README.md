# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tarek Cheikh

🎯 **IT Architect | AWS Security Expert | Open Source Builder**

I'm an IT nerd from Paris 🇫🇷 with deep roots in low-level development and cloud architecture. My journey started in the world of **C programming on Linux**, building telco and media systems, and working on **32-bit to 64-bit architecture migrations**.

Since 2014, I've shifted my focus to the **AWS ecosystem**, specializing in:
- 🔐 Cloud security
- 🏗️ Well-Architected cloud systems
- ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Cloudformation)
- 🧩 DevOps & CI/CD

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧠 Design secure, scalable cloud architectures for startups & enterprises
- 🛠️ Build automation pipelines and serverless apps
- 🧪 Experiment and publish open source AWS + Terraform projects
- 🎙️ Speaker at AWS Summit and other tech conferences
- 🧑‍💼 Founder of [Toc Consulting](https://tocconsulting.fr) — a cloud consulting company
